# mini_project
This is a python scrpit which will assemble and annotate the genome reads from a resequencing project of Escherichia coli K-12 strain. The raw read data can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX5005282 however downloading it is not necessary for the script to run.

## Required Spftware:
This script will be using wrappers to call specific bioinformatics tools that must be downloaded and installed before the script can function properly.
